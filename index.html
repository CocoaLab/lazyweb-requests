			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>12 months ago, I opened up <a href="https://github.com/paulirish/lazyweb-requests/issues">a repo</a> on Github; the idea was that my ideas were great and I didn't have time to complete them all, so I wrote them for other people to do. (lol) In reality, all of us have way more time than ideas, but it turned out some of the ideas I had were totally shared by other people, we just didn't have a meeting place to collaborate.</p>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/paulirish/lazyweb-requests/issues">lazyweb-requests</a> was set up to help front-end developers do better work by making their jobs easier.</p>
			<p>Let me give you a summary of what's happened since launch.</p>

#### MotherEffingAnimatedGIF ####
What started out as a simple enough idea from [Paul Irish] to get the drag 'n drop UI of [Drop Mocks] and the GIF power of [JSGIFF] quickly became a massive success for Lazy Web Requests.

The project was opened on 2012-02-15 20:08:50 and the [mothereffinganimatedgif] site was launched less than ***24 hours later***! 

19 participants took part in the making of this project and without them I'm sure it wouldn't have been possible to get it complete in such a short time.

				<h3>Contribute</h3>
				<p>All-in-all the experiment has been very successful. Lots of developers entering into contributing to open source look for great projects. &lt;&lt;&lt; kill? Github issues have also worked extremely well as a point of collaboration. If you're interested in contributing, please "enable notifications for this issue" or toss a comment on a thread.</p>
				<p><b>**</b> Another realization from this project is that many of these solutions were already written by developers, but aren't very googleable things, so they don't get the visibility they need. Curated lists like the <a href="https://gist.github.com/help.github.com/userscripts-and-bookmarklets/">Github userscripts page</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/bebraw/jswiki/wiki">jswiki</a> and the <a href="https://bit.ly/polyfills">Modernizr polyfills</a> wiki page do a great job of exposing developer's projects to developers when Google fails.</p>
				<p><b>**</b> Also, and this was touched on recently by Addy Osmani's post on <a href="https://gist.github.com/addyosmani.com/blog/getting-involved-with-open-source/">Getting involved in Open Source</a>, developers tend to be prone to launching their own competing project instead of contributing to an existing one. Hitting a point of critical mass in open source software seems particularly challenging. I wonder if there are ways to ameliorate</p>
				<p>Many new projects have been added as well. <strong>If you're looking for a new side project, the ones here would greatly help the web community</strong>. Take a poke around some of them!</p>
